# BMI Calculator App Sample

I completed this project with Angela Yu's bootcamp training. In this project, user inputs weight and height values using sliders. Then
, on another screen, these values are displayed, and the background color of the screen changes based on the magnitude of the value. 
Additionally, a recommendation is given to the user.
By clicking a button on this screen, the user can go back to the previous screen and perform the value calculation again.
